### How to use it ?
There are couple ways to use topcoder. This is not like the other websites that we have in the list, since it is really slow to use on browser we are using applications that will help us to dive into topcoder. Here are the applications:

- [Topcoder Arena]() - _This is must for the others. Topcoder Arena's desktop application. All OS's are supported._

Since Topcoder wants us to use classes and functions, for making it easier and faster for us we can use some third party applications which will create these for us (They have other specialities too, just check given links):

- [KawigiEdit](https://www.topcoder.com/contest/classes/KawigiEdit/KawigiEdit.html)
- [ExampleBuilder](https://community.topcoder.com/contest/classes/ExampleBuilder/ExampleBuilder.html)
